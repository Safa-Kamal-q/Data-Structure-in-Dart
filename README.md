<h1 align="center">Data Structure in Dart ✨️</h1>

## ✨️ Introduction

### 👉🏻 Overview

- In the stack folder, there is code for solving two challenges using Dart Stack.
- In the linkedList folder, there is code for solving four changes using Dart LinkedList
- Note: the descriptions for every code is written as comments in the above of the page

### 👉🏻 Challenges that were solved in this repo:

- Stacks:
    - Challenge 1: Reverse a List, Create a function that prints the contents of a list in reverse order.
    - Challenge 2: Balance the Parentheses, Check for balanced parentheses. Given a string, check if there are ( and ) characters, and return true if the parentheses in the string are balanced.
- Linked List:
    - Challenge 1: Print in Reverse, Create a function that prints the nodes of a linked list in reverse order.
    - Challenge 2: Find the Middle Node, Create a function that finds the middle node of a linked list.
    - Challenge 3: Reverse a Linked List, Create a function that reverses a linked list. You do this by manipulating the nodes so that they’re linked in the other direction.
    - Challenge 4: Remove All Occurrences, Create a function that removes all occurrences of a specific element from a linked list. The implementation is similar to the removeAfter method that you implemented earlier.

## ✨️ Installation and Usage

> Installation
> 
- Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    ```
    git clone <https://github.com/Safa-Kamal-q/Data-Structure-in-Dart.git>
    
    ```
    

> RUN
> 
- To run any file, write in terminal the following:
    
    ```
    dart nameOfFile.dart
    
    ```
    

***Note:*** be careful where you are when you try to run the file, for example: if you are in the **stack** folder:

- you can run the reverseList file like this: `dart .\\lib\\reverseList.dart`
- you can run the middleNode file like this: `dart ..\\likedList\\lib\\middleNode.dart`
